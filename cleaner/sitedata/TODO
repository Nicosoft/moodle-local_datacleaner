* Matt had a pretty cool idea to make sitedata cleanup really fast:

- spit sitedata in two plugins:

1) runs very ealry before any API calls in other plugins
2) grind through the entire file table and file all unique file types
3) create an ampty file or test file for each type, maybe have a few examples in code in the cleaner code dir
4) point all files of each type at that file

By running this first we can work with pure DB refreshes without any site data at all (in theory, need to test)



The second file plugin would do the orphaned files cleanup as follows:


* remove anything we can, like cache files and tmp dirs where possible

* delete all backup files anywhere at all

* This will look for any orphaned files no longer referenced by the DB

See https://github.com/elearningstudio/moodle-report_filetrash/
for a possible implementation
