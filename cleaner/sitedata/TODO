* Matt had a pretty cool idea to make sitedata cleanup really fast:

- split sitedata in two plugins:

1. Replace sitedata files:  ** DONE
a) runs very ealry before any API calls in other plugins  ** TODO
b) grind through the entire file table and file all unique file types ** DONE
c) create an empty file or test file for each type, maybe have a few examples in code in the cleaner code dir  ** DONE
d) point all files of each type at that file  ** DONE

By running this first we can work with pure DB refreshes without any site data at all (in theory, need to test) ** DONE - tested on an a dev VM.

TODO: 
a) generate more placeholder files for the following:
  - avi
  - bz  (probably not required)
  - flv
  - gtar
  - mov
  - mp3
  - mp4
  - odb
  - odc
  - odf
  - odi
  - odm
  - swf
  - wmv


2. The second file plugin would do the orphaned files cleanup as follows:

* This is a new sub-plugin - to be called orphaned_sitedata

* remove anything we can, like cache files and tmp dirs where possible

* delete all backup files anywhere at all

* This will look for any orphaned files no longer referenced by the DB

See https://github.com/elearningstudio/moodle-report_filetrash/
for a possible implementation
